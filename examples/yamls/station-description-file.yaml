# LaserBurrMachine Station Definitions
# Single-station gasket deburring machine
# Material flow: Manual load -> Process on XYT table -> Manual unload
EquipmentName: LaserBurrMachine
DocumentType: StationDescriptionFile

StationTypes:
  # Manual load/unload station at operator side
  # Gasket is manually loaded and unloaded at the same position
  manualLoadUnload:
    - UniqueName: OPSideStation
      Description: Operator side station for manual gasket load/unload. OP Side Shutter controls access.
      MaxMaterialCount: 1
      DownstreamStations:
        - WorkTableJig

  # Work jig on XYT motion table where all processing occurs
  # All operations (align, inspect, measure, laser, clean, reinspect) happen here
  workJig:
    - UniqueName: WorkTableJig
      Description: XYT motion table with gasket work jig. All processing operations occur at this station.
      MaxMaterialCount: 1
      DownstreamStations:
        - OPSideStation

  # NOTE: LaserHead and CO2CleanUnit are defined in hardware-description-file.yaml
  # as Hardware Units (LaserControl, Co2Cleaning) under ProcessAuxiliary System.
  # They are processing tools, not material stations.

# Material Flow Summary
# ====================
# This is a SINGLE-STATION machine - not a multi-station conveyor system.
# The gasket remains on the same WorkTableJig throughout all operations.
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Operator loads gasket at OPSideStation (shutter opens)
# 2. WorkTableJig moves through various positions for:
#    - Alignment (vision system)
#    - Inspection (burr detection)
#    - Measurement (burr height - optional)
#    - Laser deburring
#    - CO2 cleaning
#    - Re-inspection (quality verification)
# 3. WorkTableJig returns to OPSideStation for unload
# 4. Operator removes processed gasket
#
# The "downstream" relationships represent logical process flow,
# not physical material transfer between separate stations.
